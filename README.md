## 📌 About the Project  
This repo contains a collection of Java programs I wrote during my semester coursework and practice sessions. It includes basic to intermediate Java concepts, algorithms, data structures, and some client-server examples.

These programs helped me build solid Java fundamentals and get comfortable with real coding challenges.
